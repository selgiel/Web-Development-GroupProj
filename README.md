# Web-Development-GroupProj
A website created by Team 101 for Web Development module
<br>
This website is a combined effort by Team 101 where I was part of the team and in-charge of crafting the FAQ & Location page as a first-timer in web development.
<br>
Being new to web development, I was unaware of Bootstrap, Moustache, Materialize and other web development tools thus I had manually mapped out the grid
containers and coded everything by myself.
<br>
This project attained <b>78%<b> :)
